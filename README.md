# Clawdmeter

Standalone desktop dashboard for Claude Code usage — **Windows, macOS and Linux**.

       alt="Clawdmeter — the Clawd mascot reacting live to Claude Code activity, with session and weekly usage">
</p>

## What it shows

- **Session (5h) %** with reset countdown
- **Weekly (7d) %** with reset countdown — and a red **overage** state on either
  bar when it climbs past 100% onto usage credits
- **Token usage** for each window (input+output), inline beside the bars and
  broken down per session
- A **session shelf** — one Clawd mascot per active Claude Code session, each
  labeled with its session title and live activity (plus small child mascots for
  any subagents it spins up), falling back to a usage-rate mood when nothing's
  running
- Three **view modes** — the full dashboard, a slim compact list, and a tiny
  always-on-top mini readout
- A **Stats page** — what your subscription is actually worth (value vs price,
  lifetime value, cache savings) and how you use Claude (value by model and
  project, code by language, activity mix, streaks, a daily-value strip and an
  activity heatmap) — all computed locally from your transcripts
- A slim **navigation rail** down the left edge to switch between the
  **Dashboard**, the **Stats** page, and **Settings**
- **Themes** — 16 built-in light and dark presets, a follow-your-system mode, or
  a custom theme you build yourself with an on-screen eyedropper and a
  contrast checker
- A system-tray icon whose fill arc tracks session % — **hover it for a quick
  session & weekly readout**

## The mascot reacts to what Claude Code is doing

Clawd's animation and the label beneath it follow your live Claude Code session
in near-real-time — read from the local transcript:

|  |  |
|:--:|:--:|
| ![Coding](assets/mood-coding.png) | ![Reading](assets/mood-reading.png) |
| **CODING** — editing, writing, running commands | **READING** — reading, grepping, globbing |
| ![Searching](assets/mood-searching.png) | ![Thinking](assets/mood-thinking.png) |
| **SEARCHING** — web fetch / search | **THINKING** — reasoning between tool calls |
| ![Integrating](assets/mood-integrating.png) | ![Planning](assets/mood-planning.png) |
| **INTEGRATING** — MCP server tool | **PLANNING** — todos, sub-agents & task management |

The small line under the label is **what Claude Code is acting on right now** —
the file it's editing or reading (`transcript.py`), the pattern it's grepping,
the command it's running, or the host it's fetching — so you can tell *what* it's
working on, not just *that* it's working. When there's no natural target it falls
back to the bare tool name (`Edit`, `Read`, …); for an **INTEGRATING** mood it
names the MCP server and tool it's talking to (e.g. `github/list_issues`), so you
can tell which integration Claude Code reached for. An idle session's line
instead reads **last active …**, timed from the session's own last transcript
event rather than the wall clock.

When Claude Code goes quiet, the mascot falls back to a mood driven by your
usage rate — sleepy when you're idle, dancing when you're burning through
tokens (the same 4-group logic as the original firmware).

## Multiple sessions

Run more than one Claude Code session at once and each gets its own mascot on the
**session shelf** — labeled with its **session title** (the one Claude Code shows
for the conversation, or a custom title you've set, falling back to the project
folder name) and its live activity, animating independently. Long titles are
shortened to fit and **scroll into view when you hover** the label, with the full
title on the tooltip. The session/weekly usage bars stay account-wide (a single
number from the API), shown once beneath the shelf.

![Clawdmeter session shelf — one mascot per active Claude Code session, each with its session title, current activity and target, and per-window token totals on the bars](assets/Screenshot-shelf.png)

When a session spins up subagents (the Agent/Task tool), a row of small **child
mascots** appears under that session — one per live agent, each glowing with its
own activity — so a supervising session still looks busy even while its own
transcript is paused waiting on those agents.

![A session with three subagents shown as small child mascots beneath its parent mascot](assets/Screenshot-subagents.png)

The window **sizes itself to fit** the mascots, growing and shrinking as sessions
come and go so there's no empty space. Prefer a fixed size? **Drag the bottom
edge** to set your own height and it sticks; **double-click the title bar** to
snap back to the automatic fit. (Width is always yours — the shelf scrolls
horizontally when more mascots are open than fit.)

Don't want the shelf? In **Settings → Sessions**, turn **Show multiple sessions**
off for a single mascot, and **Show subagents** off to hide the child mascots.

## Token usage

Alongside the percentages, Clawdmeter shows **how many tokens you've actually
used** — read straight from your local Claude Code transcripts, no extra API
calls. The headline figure is **input + output** (the cache reads that dominate
raw totals are kept out of it, so the number reflects real work):

- **Beside the bars** — the 5h total rides the Session reset line and the 7d
  total rides the Weekly line (e.g. `resets in 2h 20m · 914K`).
- **Per session** — each mascot's tile carries that session's running total;
  hover the mascot for a full breakdown (input, output, and the cache buckets).
- **In the tray tooltip** — a `Tokens 914K (5h) · 19.4M (7d)` line under the
  usage readout.

It's all behind one switch — **Settings → Token usage → Show token usage** (on
by default). Turn it off and every token figure disappears.

## Stats

The **chart icon** in the left nav rail opens a Stats page that turns the usage
you've already racked up into a picture of what your Claude Code subscription is
actually worth. The dollar figures are **computed locally** — your transcripts
priced against a bundled rate card — enriched with Anthropic's OAuth usage
endpoint for real spend and plan details. Every visual is hand-drawn, so the
page adds nothing to the download size.

A plan badge (e.g. `Max 5× · $100/mo`) sits at the top, and below it:

- **API value this month** — what this month's usage would cost at
  pay-as-you-go API rates, measured against your subscription price (e.g. "≈ 33×
  your subscription this month"), with **lifetime value** and the **break-even
  day** (when the month's value first passed what you pay) grouped alongside.
- **Extra usage this month** — real pay-as-you-go spend beyond your plan, from
  the usage endpoint, against your monthly cap if you have one.
- **Cache savings this month** — dollars saved by prompt caching vs paying full
  input price, plus your **cache hit rate**.
- **Time to 7-day cap** — a burn-rate estimate of when you'd hit the weekly limit
  at your current pace (or "steady" / "clear" when you're not on track to).
- **Current streak** and **sessions this month** — your active-day streak (and
  best ever), and how many work sessions you've had (with average and longest).
- **Value by model** and **value by project** — where that value came from,
  broken down by model and by project folder.
- **Code by language** — the languages of the files Claude edited or created this
  month, by share of files (Python, C#, TypeScript, … with an *Other* roll-up).
- **Activity mix** — how your tool calls split across coding, reading, planning,
  thinking, searching and integrating.
- **This week vs last** — this week's value against last week's, with the change.
- **Value per day** — a per-day value bar strip across the month, with date ticks.
- **When you work** — a 7×24 weekday-by-hour heatmap of your activity.
- a **this-month recap** — top model, busiest day, biggest day ever, and totals.
- **Usage windows** — the **per-model** rate-limit windows the API reports (e.g.
  `Weekly · Opus`), kept at the very bottom. The overall 5h/7d windows aren't
  repeated here; they live on the Dashboard.

![Clawdmeter Stats page — the full page: API value and ROI, extra usage, cache savings, time to cap, streak and sessions, value by model and project, code by language, activity mix, this week vs last, value per day, a weekday-by-hour heatmap, a monthly recap and per-model usage windows](assets/Screenshot-stats.png)

## Overage

Go past a limit and keep working on paid **usage credits**, and that window's bar
switches to overage: it **empties its normal fill and restarts in red**, growing
from the left by how far past 100% you are, while the percentage keeps climbing —
so **20% over reads `120%`** — and a red **OVERAGE** tag joins the title. It works
on **both** the Session (5h) and Weekly (7d) bars — whichever window you actually
blew through — and clears itself the moment you drop back under 100%.

![Clawdmeter in overage — the Session and Weekly bars restarted in red, climbing past 100% with a red OVERAGE tag beside each title](assets/Screenshot-overage.png)

## View modes

Clawdmeter comes in three sizes and **remembers which one you left it in** across
launches. Two controls in the title bar switch between them: a **square-caret
toggle** flips between the full dashboard and the compact list, and a **mini
button** drops to the tiny readout (from there, double-click — or right-click →
**Expand** — to pop back to whichever view you came from).

**Compact** is a slim, always-on-top list — the two usage bars on top, then one
row per session: mascot, title, token total, and live activity + target — so you
can keep tabs on several sessions in a fraction of the height.

![Clawdmeter compact view — usage bars above a one-row-per-session list with mascot, title, tokens and activity](assets/Screenshot-compact-list.png)

**Mini** shrinks all the way to a frameless, always-on-top chip — the mini mascot
beside your session and weekly percentages, each with a thin usage bar and its
reset time (and the same red overage restart past 100%). It keeps no taskbar
entry and is draggable (it remembers where you left it).

![Clawdmeter mini view — a tiny always-on-top readout with the mascot and session and weekly percentages](assets/Screenshot-mini.png)

## Themes

**Settings → Appearance.** Follow your system, pick a preset, or build your own —
the whole app restyles live, with no restart.

**Follow your system** tracks the OS light/dark setting and switches between two
themes you choose: **Midnight Salmon** for dark and **Daybreak** for light by
default, though any two presets will do.

**16 presets**, nine dark and seven light:

| Dark | Light |
|---|---|
| Midnight Salmon *(default)*, Obsidian, High Contrast, Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox, Terminal Green, Amber CRT, Riptide | Daybreak, Sepia, Solarized Light, Nord Light, Gruvbox Light, High Contrast Light, Riptide Light |

![Clawdmeter Settings → Appearance — Follow System, Custom, and a Preset dropdown set to Midnight Salmon, each with a colour-swatch strip](assets/Screenshot-appearance.png)

**Build your own** opens a custom-theme editor over eight base roles —
**Background**, **Surface / cards**, **Borders**, **Text**, **Accent**,
**Warning**, **Danger** and **Positive**. Every other shade in the app is derived
from those eight, so you set a handful of colours rather than dozens.

![Clawdmeter's custom theme editor — the eight editable roles with live contrast ratios, a saturation/value picker and hue slider, a hex field with an eyedropper, and a live preview of the usage bar](assets/Screenshot-custom-theme.png)

- Pick a role, then set its colour on the picker or type a **hex** value.
- Or grab a colour from **anywhere on your screen** with the **eyedropper** —
  the whole desktop freezes and any pixel becomes the new value (on macOS this
  is Apple's own system colour sampler).
- Each role shows its **live contrast ratio** against the background as you go,
  so you can see a problem before you commit it.
- **Fix contrast** nudges the foreground roles until each clears **WCAG AA
  (4.5:1)** — so a theme you invented is still readable.
- The preview updates **live**; **Apply** commits it.
- **Import** and **Export** move a theme between machines, or share one.

## Settings

Open Settings from the **gear at the bottom of the left nav rail** — it's a
full page in the same window, alongside the Dashboard and Stats, split across
six tabs that each scroll on their own. Here's every setting, grouped by tab.

![Clawdmeter settings panel — the General tab and the tab rail](assets/Screenshot-2-Settings.png)

### General

- **Window** — toggle **Always on top**, **Auto-hide title bar** (the title bar
  collapses until you hover the top edge), and **Quit on close** (closes the app
  instead of minimizing to the tray). **Always on top** is greyed out on
  Wayland — see [Linux notes](#linux-notes).
- **Startup** — **Start when I sign in** launches Clawdmeter automatically at
  sign-in. It comes up quietly in the system tray (the menu bar on macOS), with
  no window — click the icon to open it. On a Linux desktop with **no system
  tray at all** there would be nothing to click, so it opens the window instead;
  because a desktop's panel can still be starting up at login, it waits a few
  seconds for a tray to appear before deciding.
- **Updates** — **Automatically check for updates** (on by default — checks the
  GitHub releases on launch, then about once a day) and **Check for updates now**.
- **Start menu** — add or remove a Start-menu shortcut (right-click it in Start
  to pin).

### Display

- **Sessions** — **Show multiple sessions** (the session shelf; off shows a single
  mascot for the most recent session) and **Show subagents** (the child mascots).
  Both on by default.
- **Token usage** — **Show token usage** toggles every token figure (the totals
  beside the bars, the per-session tiles and hover breakdown, and the tray line).
  On by default; read from your local transcripts, never the API.

### Appearance

- **Theme** — follow your system, pick one of the 16 built-in presets, or build
  your own. See [Themes](#themes) for the full list and the custom editor.

### Connection

- **Credentials** — by default the app reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. Use
  **Use alternative credentials** (or set `CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`) to point at
  a non-default `.credentials.json`.
- **Token** — Claude's OAuth access token expires roughly every 8 hours, which
  would otherwise blank the dashboard. With **Auto-refresh when expired** on (the
  default), the app mints a fresh token automatically so it stays live. The
  **Refresh token now** button is a manual override, enabled only when the token
  is actually expired.
- **Usage polling** — how often the app checks your usage. Each check is a tiny
  billed API request, so the interval is adjustable from **10 to 600 seconds**
  (60 by default): lower is fresher but makes more requests; higher is gentler on
  your quota when you leave it running. Out-of-range entries snap to the nearest
  allowed value.
- **Slow polling when idle** *(off by default)* — when no Claude Code session has
  been active for a configurable spell (**Back off after**, default 15 min), drop
  to a slower **idle interval** (default 300s) until activity resumes, then snap
  straight back. Cuts requests while you're away. Note your usage % is
  account-wide, so usage driven from another machine just shows up more slowly
  while idle — polling slows, it never stops.

### Notifications

Choose **what** to be alerted about, then **how** you're reached — the delivery
channels are shared across every alert.

- **On a limit reset** pings you the moment a usage limit resets so you know
  you can resume — but only when you were actually near the limit (or already
  throttled), so it stays quiet otherwise.

  ![Clawdmeter limit-reset notification — "Claude limit reset" over "Session limit has reset — you can resume."](assets/Screenshot-Session-Limit-Reset.png)

- **When approaching a limit** warns you *before* you run out — pick a separate
  **% threshold for the 5h session and the 7d week** (50–99%; defaults 90% and
  80%, since the weekly window is the scarce one you can't recover quickly). Each
  warning fires **once** when you cross its threshold and re-arms after that
  window resets, so it never nags every poll. **Also alert when I cross 100% into
  overage** adds a ping the moment either window tips onto paid usage credits.
  Off by default — flip it on when you want the heads-up.

  You choose **where** alerts reach you — pick either channel, or both. **Show a
  Windows notification** is the desktop toast plus a brief tray-icon flash, with
  **Play a sound** and **Pop the window to front** as sub-options under it; **Send
  a push notification** delivers off this machine. Under push you can **add one or
  more channels** with **Add a channel** (remove with ✕), and **every channel you
  add fires** on each alert — so you can get, say, a Pushover *and* a Discord alert
  at once. The channels are **[ntfy](https://ntfy.sh)** (subscribe to a hard-to-guess
  topic in the ntfy app — no account needed), **Telegram** (a bot token from
  @BotFather + your chat ID), **Discord** / **Slack** (an incoming-webhook URL),
  **Pushover** (an app API token + your user key), **Gotify** (a self-hosted server
  URL + app token), and a **generic webhook** (a JSON `{title, body, app}` POST to
  any URL — wire it to Zapier / Make / IFTTT / n8n / Home Assistant). Each channel's
  in-app hint says where to get its credential; keep topics/tokens/URLs secret,
  since anyone with them can post to or read your alerts. **Send test notification**
  fires every configured channel at once.

## Windows, macOS and Linux

The same app, the same features, on all three — one codebase, no reduced
edition anywhere. Each build uses its platform's own window chrome and its own
tray, so it looks native rather than ported.

**macOS** gets a real transparent title bar with the native traffic lights, and
lives in the menu bar rather than a system tray. The download is **universal** —
one file for both Apple Silicon and Intel.

![Clawdmeter on macOS — the dashboard in a native transparent-titlebar window with traffic lights, two active sessions, and the weekly bar in its red overage state](assets/Screenshot-macos.png)

**Linux** runs on X11 and Wayland, with the tray icon provided by AppIndicator /
KStatusNotifierItem — see [Linux notes](#linux-notes) for the two Wayland
differences and what to do if no tray icon appears. It ships **two ways**, and
neither supersedes the other: the **AppImage** is a single file you make
executable and run, while the **tarball**'s `install.sh` registers a proper
menu entry. Pick by whether you'd rather have zero install steps or a launcher.

![Clawdmeter on Linux — the dashboard with three active sessions showing SEARCHING, INTEGRATING and IDLE, and the session bar in its red overage state](assets/Screenshot-linux.png)

On every platform the tray/menu-bar icon carries the same menu — **Show**, the
three view modes, **Check for updates** and **Quit**. On macOS the icon is a
template image, so it follows the menu bar in both light and dark appearance:

![Clawdmeter's macOS menu-bar icon with its menu open — Show, Full view, Compact view, Mini view, Check for updates, Quit](assets/Screenshot-macos-menu.png)

## Download

Grab your platform's build from the [Releases](../../releases) page. Each one
bundles Python + Qt, so there's nothing else to install.

| Platform | File | Size | How to run it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | `Clawdmeter.exe` | ~31 MB | Single self-contained file — just run it. |
| **macOS** | `Clawdmeter.dmg` | ~81 MB | Open it, drag **Clawdmeter** to Applications. Universal — one download for both Apple Silicon and Intel. |
| **macOS** (zip) | `Clawdmeter-macos.zip` | ~72 MB | The same `.app`, if you'd rather not mount a disk image. |
| **Linux** | `Clawdmeter-3.0.1-x86_64.AppImage` | ~57 MB | `chmod +x` it and run. One file, no install, delete it to uninstall. |
| **Linux** (tarball) | `Clawdmeter-3.0.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | ~56 MB | Unpack and run `./install.sh` — it drops the binary in `~/.local/bin` and **adds a menu entry**. |

Every file ships with a `.sha256` beside it. Verify before running if you like:
`sha256sum -c Clawdmeter-3.0.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha256` (or `shasum -a 256` /
`Get-FileHash`).

Clawdmeter checks the Releases page for a newer version on launch (then about
once a day) and, when one's out, shows an **Update available** item in the tray
menu — click it to open the download page and swap in the new build. You can
turn the automatic check off, or trigger one on demand, under **Settings →
Updates**.

> **Heads up: none of the builds are code-signed yet**, so each OS will question
> them the first time:
>
> - **Windows** — SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC / unknown
>   publisher". Click **More info → Run anyway**.
> - **macOS** — Gatekeeper says the app "cannot be opened because the developer
>   cannot be verified". Right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**, or allow it
>   under **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. (The app is ad-hoc signed,
>   which is not the same as notarized.)
> - **Linux** — no prompt; make sure the binary is executable (`install.sh` does
>   this for you).
>
> If you'd rather not trust a binary, [run from source](#run-from-source) or
> [build it yourself](#building).

## How it works

It reads your Claude Code OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` — or
from the **login Keychain** on macOS, where Claude Code stores it instead —
sends a minimal 1-token request to `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` on a
configurable interval (60s by default), and reads the rate-limit headers from
the response. On the same poll it also reads Anthropic's OAuth usage and profile
endpoints (`/api/oauth/usage`, `/api/oauth/profile`) for your plan, extra-usage
spend and per-model limits. The Stats page values your **local transcripts**
against a bundled price map — no extra API calls. The window minimises to the
system tray; closing the window hides it. **Quit** from the tray menu fully
exits.

## Linux notes

Clawdmeter runs on X11 and Wayland. Two things behave differently on **Wayland**,
and neither is fixable from the application side — Wayland deliberately does not
let a program raise or place its own windows:

- **Always on top does nothing**, so the setting is greyed out rather than left
  looking broken. Use your compositor's own always-on-top shortcut instead — on
  GNOME that's the window menu (`Alt`+`Space`) → **Always on Top**.
- **The mini and compact views don't reopen where you left them.** The app still
  remembers the position; the compositor decides where the window actually goes.

Both work normally on an X11 session if you need them.

**No tray icon?** GNOME has no system tray of its own. Install the
**AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support** extension and the icon appears.
Clawdmeter says so on startup if it can't find a tray — the window works either
way. A tray icon that shows up late (a panel still loading at login) is fine:
the icon docks by itself the moment a tray host registers.

**Missing Qt xcb plugin?** If the app exits with a `xcb` platform-plugin error,
install the one system library it needs — `libxcb-cursor0` on Debian/Ubuntu,
`xcb-util-cursor` on Fedora/Arch. `install.sh` prints this too.

## Requirements

- **Windows** 10 or 11
- **macOS** 13 or newer — universal (Apple Silicon + Intel)
- **Linux** — a current desktop with **glibc 2.35 or newer** (Ubuntu 22.04+,
  Fedora 36+, Debian 12+). The release binary is built on Ubuntu 22.04 so it
  works on that floor and everything above it; older distributions need a
  [source run](#run-from-source) instead.
- Only to run from source or build: **Python 3.10 or newer** (the code uses
  3.10+ syntax)

## Run from source

Windows:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python src\main.py
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
./.venv/bin/python src/main.py
```

Add `--mock` to drive the UI with synthetic data (no API calls) — handy for
seeing every state without burning tokens.

## Building

| Platform | Command | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `.\build.ps1` | `dist\Clawdmeter.exe` — single file, no console window, ~31 MB |
| Linux | `bash build.sh` | `dist/Clawdmeter`, `Clawdmeter-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` **and** `Clawdmeter-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` (each + `.sha256`) |
| macOS | `bash build-macos.sh` | `dist/Clawdmeter.app`, `Clawdmeter-macos.zip` and `Clawdmeter.dmg` (each + `.sha256`) |

Each build must run **on** the platform it targets — there is no cross-compiling.

**macOS: install python.org's Python first, or you get a single-arch app.** The
`.app` is universal2 only when the interpreter carries both slices, and every
compiled dependency (PySide6, pyobjc) already ships universal2 wheels — so the
interpreter is the only thing that decides. `uv`-managed and Homebrew CPythons
are single-arch. Use:

```bash
curl -LO https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.10/python-3.12.10-macos11.pkg
sudo installer -pkg python-3.12.10-macos11.pkg -target /
```

It's picked up automatically from `/Library/Frameworks`. Confirm the result with
`lipo -archs dist/Clawdmeter.app/Contents/MacOS/Clawdmeter` — you want
`x86_64 arm64`.

**Linux: build on the oldest glibc you intend to support.** PyInstaller vendors
the host's system libraries, so a binary built on a newer distribution simply
will not start on an older one. The releases are built on Ubuntu 22.04
(glibc 2.35). **This applies to the AppImage too** — an AppImage bundles the
app's libraries, not glibc, so it does not widen compatibility.

`build.sh` fetches a pinned `appimagetool` (never the rolling `continuous` tag)
and verifies its checksum. If it can't, the AppImage is **skipped with a
warning** and the tarball is still produced — CI turns that skip into a hard
failure so a release can't quietly ship without it. The AppImage embeds the
type2 runtime, which links libfuse statically: users need neither `libfuse2` nor
`libfuse3` installed.

`Clawdmeter.spec` prunes the parts of PySide6/Qt the app doesn't use (the
QML/Quick stack, the ~20 MB software-OpenGL fallback, unused image-format and
platform plugins, and Qt's bundled translations) to keep the exe roughly half
the size of an unpruned PySide6 build. If you start importing additional Qt
modules, check the pruning block in the spec so you don't strip something you
now need.
