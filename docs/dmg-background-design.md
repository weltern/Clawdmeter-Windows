# DMG background — design is LOCKED

**Status: final. Nick signed off 2026-07-26. Do not redesign, "improve," or
revert this without his explicit say-so.**

The macOS drag-to-install background is the **"Light · THINKING"** design,
settled after a nine-round mockup pass (full history in the session artifact:
<https://claude.ai/code/artifact/32b7244e-7e2f-4b45-9c5f-2b7eb9b672d8>).
Landed in commit `52034f4` on `feat/macos-native-window`.

## What it is

- Flat warm-paper field `#f6f1ea` with subtle deterministic grain
- Clawd's session-shelf treatment baked around the app icon slot:
  THINKING-blue (`#5B8DEF`) silhouette glow painted where Finder places the
  icon, `● THINKING` + `PONDERING ITS NEW HOME` beneath
- Four salmon (`#CE7D6B`) chevrons stepping toward Applications
- One instruction line: *Drag Clawdmeter to Applications*

## Files (keep together)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `packaging/make_dmg_background.py` | Renders the art (source of truth) |
| `packaging/dmg-background.png` / `@2x.png` | Checked-in output — regenerate only via the script |
| `packaging/dmg_settings.py` | Icon slots (150,190)/(450,190) @128 — geometry mirrored in the art script; change both or neither |

Regenerate with `python packaging/make_dmg_background.py` — output is
byte-reproducible (grain is seeded), so a clean regen produces no diff.

## If this conflicts in a merge

Keep the `52034f4` version (or whatever descendant of it carries this doc).
The pre-2026-07-26 art (dark field, dotted-arrow) is obsolete — a conflict
resolution that resurrects it is a regression.

## Why the light field (platform constraints, verified)

These are facts, not taste — rediscovering them costs a session:

1. A DMG background is **one baked image**; it cannot follow system dark/light.
2. With any custom background, **Finder draws the filename labels in dark
   light-mode style in every system theme** (verified via the DropDMG
   developer and by extracting Slack/Discord/Arc's shipped DMGs — all light).
   A dark field makes "Clawdmeter"/"Applications" unreadable for everyone.
3. The titlebar is Finder chrome and follows the *user's* theme — art/chrome
   mismatch is unavoidable for half the audience and is normal (VS Code,
   Slack, et al. all live with it).

One open verification: the glow-behind-icon trick assumes Finder's `.icns`
rendering aligns with `assets/icon.png`'s silhouette. Eyeball the first real
mounted DMG on the Mac VM before it ships in a release.
