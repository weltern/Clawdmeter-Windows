    A sign-in launch belongs in the tray. Where there is no tray to stay in --
    some Linux DEs have none -- staying hidden would leave the app invisible and
    unrecoverable, so the window has to show instead.

    The trap is that at LOGIN the app can beat the panel's tray host to the
    socket, so the snapshot taken in ``Dashboard.__init__`` reads "no tray" on a
    desktop that is about to have one, and acting on it pops a window at every
    single login. Re-poll instead of trusting that snapshot -- the same reason
    ``Dashboard.closeEvent`` re-queries rather than reusing it.

    Nothing has to be done when a host does turn up: the tray icon is already
    ``show()``n, so it docks by itself. All this has to get right is *not*
    showing the window.

    Only the no-tray answer is delayed. A DE that genuinely has none waits
    ``grace_ms`` before its window appears, which is nothing against a login.

    ``available`` is injectable so the wait can be tested without a real tray.
